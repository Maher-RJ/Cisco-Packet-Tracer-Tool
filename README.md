# Packet-Tracer-Tool

#### Abstract
Nowadays the internet provides many services such as Emails, chats, E-learning, E-health, online banking, and multiplayers online games. Computer networks in these services plays an important role as they allow the exchange information among many connected devices. So, in this report, a simple wireless network will be implemented and simulated using a network simulator tool, i.e. Cisco packet tracer, while focusing on how packets move among different devices to understand various concepts, such as connectivity by visualizing ICMP and TCP packet flow and analyze broadcasts.
